'''This is my simple Dice simulating game program that allows users to play(roll a die) and of course with
their permission, if the user wants to play, the program will perform the while loop statement generating
different outputs of a dice. Otherwise  program will jump the while loop and print "Thank you for playing"
on the user screen. Again if the user want to play more, program will continue gereating different die outputs,
and when the user is tired of playing they'll tell the program and the program will stop executing the while
loop statement and print "Thank you for playing" again.'''
